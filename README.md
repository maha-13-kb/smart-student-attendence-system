# SMART STUDENT STTENDENCE SYSTEM
An intelligent management system that uses the webcam to recognize the studentâ€™s face to manage the attendance records

# ABSTRACT
The face recognition student attendance system emphasizes its simplicity by eliminating classical student attendance marking techniques such as calling student names or checking respective identification cards. Hence, there is a need to develop a real-time operating student attendance system which means the identification process must be done within defined time constraints to prevent omission. The extracted features from facial images that represent the identity of the students have to be consistent towards a change in background, illumination, pose, and expression. High accuracy and fast computation time will be the evaluation points of the performance.

# DATASET
The train and test dataset was collected in real-time from my classmates. For privacy purpose, the project contains celebrities photos.

# PACKAGES USED
1. OpenCV : OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

2. dlib : This library contains algorithms which is used to construct  face embeddings used for the actual recognition process.

3. face_recognition: Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with.
