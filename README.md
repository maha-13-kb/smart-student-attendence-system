# smart-student-attendence-system
An intelligent management system that uses the webcam to recognize the studentâ€™s face to manage the attendance records

# ABSTRACT
The face recognition student attendance system emphasizes its simplicity by eliminating classical student attendance marking techniques such as calling student names or checking respective identification cards. Hence, there is a need to develop a real-time operating student attendance system which means the identification process must be done within defined time constraints to prevent omission. The extracted features from facial images that represent the identity of the students have to be consistent towards a change in background, illumination, pose, and expression. High accuracy and fast computation time will be the evaluation points of the performance.
